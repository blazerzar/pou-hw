# Exercise 2.2

## Problem

Show that $\mathcal{C} = \sigma(\mathcal{C})$ if and only if $\mathcal{C}$ is a
sigma algebra.

## Solution

To show equivalence $\mathcal{C} = \sigma(\mathcal{C}) \iff \mathcal{C}
\text{ is a sigma algebra}$, we must show implication in both directions.

$(\implies)$ Left side is given: $\mathcal{C} = \sigma(\mathcal{C})$.

By definition $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ is a sigma algebra. It equals
$\mathcal{C}$, so $\mathcal{C}$ must be a sigma algebra as well.

$(\impliedby)$ Right side is given: $\mathcal{C} \text{ is a sigma algebra}$.

By definition of sigma algebra generated by the set $\mathcal{C}$, all elements
of this set must be in it, i.e.,

$$
\mathcal{C} \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{C}).
$$

From the definition it also follows that this sigma algebra is the smallest
sigma algebra containing all elements of $\mathcal{C}$. It follows that it
has to be a subset of other sigma algebras containing elements of $\mathcal{C}$ -
like $\mathcal{C}$ itself:

$$
\sigma(\mathcal{C}) \subseteq C.
$$

These two results give $\mathcal{C} = \sigma(\mathcal{C})$.

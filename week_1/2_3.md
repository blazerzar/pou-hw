# Exercise 2.3

## Problem

Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be two collections of subsets on $\Omega$
such that $\mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{D}$. Prove that
$\sigma(\mathcal{C}) \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{D})$.

## Solution

By definition of sigma algebra generated by the set $\mathcal{D}$,

$$
\mathcal{D} \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{D}).
$$

Since $\mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{D} \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{D})$, it
follows that

$$
\mathcal{C} \subset \sigma(\mathcal{D}).
$$

Because $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ is the smallest sigma algebra containing all
elements of $\mathcal{C}$, it follows that it has to be a subset of other sigma
algebras containing elements of $\mathcal{C}$. One of such sigma algebras is
$\sigma(\mathcal{D})$:

$$
\sigma(\mathcal{C}) \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{D}).
$$

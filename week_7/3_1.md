# Exercise 3.1

## Problem

A military officer is in charge of identifying enemy aircraft and shooting them
down. He is able to positively identify an enemy airplane $95\%$ of the time and
positively identify a friendly airplane $90\%$ of the time. Furthermore, $99\%$
of the airplanes are friendly. When the officer identifies an airplane as an
enemy airplane, what is the probability that it is not and they will shoot at
a friendly airplane?

## Solution

Let $O$ be a random variable with values $0$ and $1$ corresponding to office
identifying a friendly and an enemy airplane, respectively. Let $A$ be a random
variable with values $0$ and $1$ corresponding to an airplane being friendly
and an enemy, respectively.

From problem description we can directly write down the following probabilities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(A = 0) &= 0.99, \\
    P(O = 0 | A = 0) &= 0.9, \\
    P(O = 1 | A = 1) &= 0.95. \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Using properties of probability, we can calculate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(A = 1) &= 1 - P (A = 0) = 0.01, \\
    P(O = 1 | A = 0) &= 1 - P(O = 0 | A = 0) = 0.1, \\
    P(O = 0 | A = 1) &= 1 - P(O = 1 | A = 1) = 0.05. \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now use Bayes' theorem and law of total probability to calculate the result:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(A = 0 | O = 1) &= \frac{P(O = 1 | A = 0) P(A = 0)}{P(O = 1)} = \\
    &= \frac{P(O = 1 | A = 0) P(A = 0)}{
        P(O = 1 | A = 0) P(A = 0) + P(P = 1 | A = 1) P(A = 1)
    } = \\
    &= 0.91 .
\end{aligned}
$$

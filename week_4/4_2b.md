# Exercise 4.2b

## Problem

Let $X$ be a random variable with CDF

$$
F_X(x) = \begin{cases}
    0,                                           & x < 0, \\
    \frac{x^2}{2},                               & 0 \le x < 1, \\
    \frac{1}{2} + \frac{p}{2},                   & 1 \le x < 2, \\
    \frac{1}{2} + \frac{p}{2} + \frac{1 - p}{2}, & x \ge 2.
\end{cases}
$$

Find the probability density/mass of $X$.

## Solution

Since $X$ is a mixed random varible, it has both probability density and
mass function.

Probability mass function $f_X$ is defined on $0 \le x < 1$ and is obtained
by differentiating cumulative distribution function $F_X$:

$$
f_X(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \frac{x^2}{2} = x .
$$

There are two jumps in the CDF $F_X$, so PMF is defined for two points:

$$
p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{p}{2},     & x = 1, \\
    \frac{1 - p}{2}, & x = 2 .
\end{cases}
$$

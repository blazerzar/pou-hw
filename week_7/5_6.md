# Exercise 5.6

## Problem

Let $(X, Y, Z)$ be uniformly distributed on the unit ball
$\{(x, y, z)\ |\ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \le 1\}$. Let $R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2}$.
Find CDF and PDF of $R$.

## Solution

First we find the CDF of $R$. It is the probability that $R$ is less than some
value $r$. This is the same as the ratio between volumes of the ball with
radius $r$ and unit ball:

$$
F_R(r) = P(R \le r) = P(\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2} \le r) =
    \frac{4\pi r^3}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{4\pi 1^3} = r^3
$$

for $0 \le r \le 1$.

The PDF is the derivative of the CDF:

$$
f_R(r) = \frac{dF_R}{dr} = 3r^2.
$$
